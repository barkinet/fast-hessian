# Fast Hessian

High-performance C++ implementation of Hessian 2.0 Serialization Protocol for Node.js.

External Javascript API are 100% compatible with [Hessian.js](https://github.com/node-modules/hessian.js), serving as a drop-in replacement. Only the Hessian 2.0 part is re-implemented in C++; Hessian 1.0 is untouched with its original implementation. 

## Compete with Hessian.js

**Environment: node 8.0.0-pre + v8 5.7.492.69**
